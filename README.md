# Earthquake1970

I used Kaggle to extract a data set to measure the magnitude of an earthquakes from 1970 to 2011. I extracted the data, the proceeded to extract the top 5 which is a default in the head () function. I then extracted the column "Magnitude" since that uis the only data im trying to extract, I wanted to know the mean of all the earthquakes so I used the meanfunction to get the calculations. I then wanted to know what was the max magnitude in the size of the earth quake for this I used the Max function on the Magnitude column. I am currently still working on the extraction of data on answering some questions to build a solid story line of the data. I plotted where the 9.1 happen and when it happened .
